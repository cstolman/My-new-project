# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Find a job by reviewing all open job descriptions that match my criteria and select 4 per week.  Modify resume to match the job requirements, apply for the job and get four interview per week.


## Background

Everyone at some time needs to find a job.  Finding a job is very difficult for anyone in any field or level.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* How to research open job opportunities
* How to screen the opportunities to match the applicants' skills, experience and location.
* How to update resume.
* How to apply for the jobs and screen for responses.
* Screen positive responses and apply for interview.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?



## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[LinkedIn(https://linkedin.com/jobs)
[Indeed(https://Indeed.com)


| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

There are too many jobs to compare specifically to the requirements.

## What next?

I need assistance to do any programming
